(whitepaper in progress)

SOLES has worked with top legal & financial experts to craft our SOLES-EECoin token offering, a blockchain asset class pegged to an indexed price of real-world renewable resource asset instruments. Energy Efficiency Coin (EECoin) is a blockchain asset class with mininal electrical usage, minimal hardware turnover, and even offers a positive environmental impact. By utilizing energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols and devoting the equity to purchasing green financial instruments, usage and funding of EECoin promotes the creation of renewable versus non-renewable energy, as opposed to blockchain token systems which utilize Proof-of-Work protocols, where higher utilization and coin market prices mean more incentive for “miners” to burn electricity to gain the tokens.
